# Prerequisites & Assumptions

The following assumptions are made about you and your project when following any of the instructions or tips here:

* You have intermediate to advanced knowledge about Unreal Engine and programming.
* You already set up a product at https://dev.epicgames.com/portal/.
* Your project is made in Unreal Engine 5.3.1.
* You are using the following plugins by Redpoint Games (they are not strictly required, but I will use them in my research as I do not intend to re-invent the wheel)
    * https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/eos-online-subsystem
    * https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/online-subsystem-blueprints
    * https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/matchmaking
* You are using EOS SDK version 1.15.5. (some "bugs" / changes are present in 1.16.1 that break some functionality with the Matchmaker)

# Infrastructure

## Hetzner

From https://github.com/vitobotta/hetzner-k3s: 

> Hetzner Cloud is an awesome cloud provider which offers a truly great service with the best performance/cost ratio in the market and locations in both Europe and USA.

I have been personally using them for many years now and will use them for my research. If you do not have an account yet, you can make one using this link and get 20€ credit for free: https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=Bt8CbhKVbAFX

This credit can be used to deploy the dev cluster.

## Private Network

A set of machines and clients will need to be able to talk to each other. Specifically:

* K3S agents that will run the game server image. They need to be able to talk to one or more control nodes that are responsible for managing the cluster.
* Pipeline runners need to be able to push docker images to a registry.
* Said registry need to be accessible by agents, runners & possibly workstations that want to manually push images. (though it would probably be better if they had a local cluster running)

## Build Pipeline

## Kubernetes Cluster
